# Instructions

* Always activate venv before running any commands (install, test, etc.)
* Always use Makefile commands for running tests, builds, and other operations
* Code commenting guidelines:
  - Test files: Do NOT add any comments
  - Source code: Only add method-level docstrings (one per method), no inline comments
